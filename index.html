        <p>
          Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why Laravel?
          There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Progressive Framework</li>
          <p>
            We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and <a class="insert-link" href="https://laracasts.com/">video tutorials</a> will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.
            If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.
          </p>
          <li>A Scalable Framework</li>
          <p>
            Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.
            Need extreme scaling? Platforms like <a class="insert-link" href="https://vapor.laravel.com/">Laravel Vapor</a> allow you to run your Laravel application at nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.
          </p>
          <li>A Community Framework</li>
          <p>
            Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have <a class="insert-link" href="https://github.com/laravel/framework">contributed to the framework</a>. Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Routing">
        <header>Routing</header>
        <p>
          The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation">
          use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
          
          Route::get('/greeting', function () {
              return 'Hello World';
          });
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Controllers">
        <header>Controllers</header>
        <p>To quickly generate a new controller, you may run the make:controller Artisan command. By default, all of the controllers for your application are stored in the app/Http/Controllers directory:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation">
            php artisan make:controller UserController
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example of a basic controller. A controller may have any number of public methods which will respond to incoming HTTP requests:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation php">
            &lt;?php
        
            namespace App\Http\Controllers;
        
            use App\Models\User;
            use Illuminate\View\View;
        
            class UserController extends Controller
            {
                /**
                 * Show the profile for a given user.
                 */
                public function show(string $id): View
                {
                    return view('user.profile', [
                        'user' => User::findOrFail($id)
                    ]);
                }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Migration">
        <header>Migration</header>
        <p>You may use the make:migration Artisan command to generate a database migration. The new migration will be placed in your database/migrations directory. Each migration filename contains a timestamp that allows Laravel to determine the order of the migrations:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation">
            php artisan make:migration create_flights_table
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Seeding">
        <header>Seeding</header>
        <p>To generate a seeder, execute the make:seeder Artisan command. All seeders generated by the framework will be placed in the database/seeders directory:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation">
            php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          A seeder class only contains one method by default: run. This method is called when the db:seed Artisan command is executed. Within the run method, you may insert data into your database however you wish. You may use the query builder to manually insert data or you may use Eloquent model factories.
          <br></br>
          As an example, let's modify the default DatabaseSeeder class and add a database insert statement to the run method:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="code-documentation">
              &lt;?php
 
              namespace Database\Seeders;
              
              use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
              use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
              use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;
              use Illuminate\Support\Str;
              
              class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
              {
                  /**
                  * Run the database seeders.
                  */
                  public function run(): void
                  {
                      DB::table('users')->insert([
                          'name' => Str::random(10),
                          'email' => Str::random(10).'@example.com',
                          'password' => Hash::make('password'),
                      ]);
                  }
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Eloquent_ORM">
        <header>Eloquent ORM</header>
        <p>
          To get started, let's create an Eloquent model. Models typically live in the app\Models directory and extend the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model class. You may use the make:model Artisan command to generate a new model:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code-documentation">
            php artisan make:model Flight -a
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Database tables are often related to one another. For example, a blog post may have many comments or an order could be related to the user who placed it. Eloquent makes managing and working with these relationships easy, and supports a variety of common relationships:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One To One</li>
          <li>One To Many</li>
          <li>Many To Many</li>
          <li>Has One Through</li>
          <li>Has Many Through</li>
          <li>One To One (Polymorphic)</li>
          <li>One To Many (Polymorphic)</li>
          <li>Many To Many (Polymorphic)</li>
        </ul>
